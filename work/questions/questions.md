Are the steady states mentioned stable steady states?

When it comes to racipe has it been studied what kind of parameters lead to hybrid states? And if there's any relationship between plasticity and phenotypic heterogeneity?

Biases introduced by formalisms and update functions. Can the formalism lead to all possible outcomes?

Mapping the landscape using emergent properties of asynchrouns mapping.

The metric involving length or rather time taken to reach a stable state.

Can cellular automata be used to model these networks   



Why do hybrid states take lesser time to converge? What does it say about them? 

Ideally I'd expect hybrid states to be somewhat less optimal and therefore "harder to reach" so what does it mean really?
