Trivial things I should do :
    
    1. Plot a distribution of epimes score for states reaching each of the attractors
    2. Calculate the number of perturbations needed to "dissipate" the attractor, is it possible? to what extent can an attractor be "dissipated"?
            If we do it just on the attractor, then its as simple as switching between teams and we do not what that since it's trivial, for this we need some "dynamic neighbors" if possible
            therefore the question is what kind of funnel do we have for the attractors? if we have?

    Assume we have a deep funnel, not wide. Can we widen it? without affecting the deepness? Is it possible to create very wide funnels with no depth? Again all of this depends on the rules. 
    An example for the most shallow-ness one might achieve would be all nodes independent without any regulation between them. But again if you do have multiple nodes 

Synchronus update can be expressed as multiplication of each state by connectivity matrix

I can also look into derrida values and see if somehow these networks are at "the edge of chaos"

The question remains, how do I check for the funnel shape? The distribution might give some idea about it.
