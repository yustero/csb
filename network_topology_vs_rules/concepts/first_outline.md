#Outline 

We do not have the boolean rules figured for a lot of biological networks and it takes a lot of effort. There are ways to search them using brute force but don't know much about them. 

The outline of the project is to see if there are some set/category of boolean functions which act somewhat similar to threshold based boolean rules.

Something about constancy of fixed points in the steady state distribution.

See if we can identify hybrid nodes in other networks with different rules.
