Have you looked into optimality of networks? If there is some sort of optimality. So far I've read about robustness.

Why do we conserve the in and out degree during randomization?

What causes the hybrid states to cluster and not cluster? What dictates if there is a continuum of possible hybrid states between the extremes? If there isn't a continuum then how could we possibly determine the number of hybrid states possible 

How are teams formed?

Does the stable state graph correspond to hybrid solutions ? 
Or are the certain solutions just filtered off due to external selective pressures and hybrid solutions just give a range to sample from.
