What do I have to look at? 

Study artificial networks for hybrid nodes and figure out what causes hybrid nodes and wether getting rid of impurities can get rid of hybrid nodes. And make small world networks please. 


What I have to do right now is to relax the absoluteneess of the metric and plot graphs. Ignore the static metric I thought of cause idk what it means really. 

Why do we not see hybrid nodes in artificial networks ?
